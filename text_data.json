[{"id": 1, "content": "Most organizations and leaders get into trouble in the implementation phase of the leadership process. With self-serving leaders at the helm, the traditional hierarchical pyramid is kept alive and well. When that happens, who do people think they work for? The people above them. The minute you think you work for the person above you for implementation, you are assuming that person — your boss — is responsible and your job is being responsive to that boss and to his or her whims or wishes. Now \"boss watching\" becomes a popular sport and people get promoted on their upward-influencing skills. As a result, all the energy of the organization is moving up the hierarchy, away from customers and the frontline folks who are closest to the action. What you get is a duck pond. When there is a conflict between what the customers want and what the boss wants, the boss wins.

That was the first word that Steven saw when he opened the envelope that his dad handed to him. He knew that he would win the essay contest.

He picked them up and read the letter thoroughly while sitting on the stairs in front of his house. \"Wait a minute! That's not my name!\" he said, puzzled. The letter was addressed to his classmate Stephanie, who had also participated in the contest. Reading on, Steven realized the letter had been delivered mistakenly. \"Unfortunately,\" it should have gone to Stephanie, who was the real winner. He looked at the tickets and then the letter. He had really wanted those tickets. He had planned to go there with his younger sister. Steven was his sister's hero, and he had bragged to her that he would win the contest. However, if she found out that her hero hadn't won, she would be terribly disappointed, and he would feel ashamed. \"If I don't tell Stephanie, perhaps she will never know,\" Steven thought for a moment. He remembered that the winner would only be notified by mail. As long as he kept quiet, nobody would know. So he decided to sleep on it. The next morning, he felt miserable and his dad recognized it right away. \"What's wrong, Son?\" asked his dad. Steven was hesitant at first but soon disclosed his secret. After listening attentively to the end, his dad advised him to do the right thing. Once Steven had heard his dad's words, tears started to fill up in his eyes. \"I was foolish,\" Steven said regretfully. He took the letter and the prize to school and handed them to Stephanie. He congratulated her wholeheartedly and she was thrilled. On the way home after school, his steps were light and full of joy. That night, his dad was very pleased to hear what he had done at school. \"I am so proud of you, Steven,\" he said.

This is accomplished by randomization; that is, the subjects are chosen randomly from the same population by flipping a coin or some other method involving chance. Randomization helps to ensure that results reflect the treatment and not factors that might influence the grouping of subjects. Importantly, the two groups of people must be similar and must have the same track record with respect to colds to rule out the possibility that observed differences in the rate, severity, or duration of colds might have occurred anyway. If, for example, the control group would normally catch twice as many colds as the experimental group, then the findings prove nothing. In experiments involving a nutrient, the diets of both groups must also be similar, especially with respect to the nutrient being studied. If those in the experimental group were receiving less vitamin C from their usual diet, then any effects of the supplement may not be apparent.", "base_form": "effectiveness", "pos": "명사", "meaning_ko": "효과성, 효율성, 결과를 이루는 능력", "meaning_en": "power to be effective; the quality of being able to bring about an effect", "type": "사용자단어", "is_separated": false, "confidence": 1.0, "frequency": 2, "synonyms": "potency / strength / effectivity / effectualness / effectuality", "antonyms": "ineffectiveness"}, {"original": "coin", "context": "This is accomplished by randomization; that is, the subjects are chosen randomly from the same population by flipping a coin or some other method involving chance", "base_form": "coin", "pos": "명사", "meaning_ko": "금속으로 만든 작은 둥근 동전", "meaning_en": "a flat metal piece (usually a disc) used as money", "type": "사용자단어", "is_separated": false, "confidence": 1.0, "frequency": 1, "synonyms": "", "antonyms": ""}], "metadata": {}}, {"id": 9, "content": "Many negotiators assume that all negotiations involve a fixed pie. Negotiators often approach integrative negotiation opportunities as zero-sum situations or win-lose exchanges. Those who believe in the mythical fixed pie assume that parties’ interests stand in opposition, with no possibility for integrative settlements and mutually beneficial trade-offs, so they suppress efforts to search for them. In a hiring negotiation, a job applicant who assumes that salary is the only issue may insist on $75,000 when the employer is offering $70,000. Only when the two parties discuss the possibilities further do they discover that moving expenses and starting date can also be negotiated, which may facilitate resolution of the salary issue. The tendency to see negotiation in fixed-pie terms varies depending on how people view the nature of a given conflict situation. This was shown in a clever experiment by Harinck, de Dreu, and Van Vianen involving a simulated negotiation between prosecutors and defense lawyers over jail sentences. Some participants were told to view their goals in terms of personal gain (e.g., arranging a particular jail sentence will help your career), others were told to view their goals in terms of effectiveness (a particular sentence is most likely to prevent recidivism), and still others were told to focus on values (a particular jail sentence is fair and just). Negotiators focusing on personal gain were most likely to come under the influence of fixed-pie beliefs and approach the situation competitively. Negotiators focusing on values were least likely to see the problem in fixed-pie terms and more inclined to approach the situation cooperatively. Stressful conditions such as time constraints contribute to this common misperception, which in turn may lead to less integrative agreements.", "words": [{"original": "in terms of", "context": "Some participants were told to view their goals in terms of personal gain (e", "base_form": "in terms of", "pos": "숙어/관용어", "meaning_ko": "~에 관한, ~의 관점에서, ~라는 측면에서", "meaning_en": "", "type": "고정숙어", "is_separated": false, "confidence": 1.0, "frequency": 1, "synonyms": "", "antonyms": ""}, {"original": "cooperatively", "context": "Negotiators focusing on values were least likely to see the problem in fixed-pie terms and more inclined to approach the situation cooperatively", "base_form": "cooperatively", "pos": "부사", "meaning_ko": "협력적으로", "meaning_en": "in close cooperation", "type": "사용자단어", "is_separated": false, "confidence": 1.0, "frequency": 1, "synonyms": "hand and glove / hand in glove", "antonyms": ""}, {"original": "beneficial", "context": "Those who believe in the mythical fixed pie assume that parties’ interests stand in opposition, with no possibility for integrative settlements and mutually beneficial trade-offs, so they suppress efforts to search for them", "base_form": "beneficial", "pos": "형용사", "meaning_ko": "이익이 되는, 유익한, 도움이 되는", "meaning_en": "promoting or enhancing well-being", "type": "사용자단어", "is_separated": false, "confidence": 1.0, "frequency": 1, "synonyms": "good", "antonyms": ""}, {"original": "suppress", "context": "Those who believe in the mythical fixed pie assume that parties’ interests stand in opposition, with no possibility for integrative settlements and mutually beneficial trade-offs, so they suppress efforts to search for them", "base_form": "suppress", "pos": "동사", "meaning_ko": "억제하다, 진압하다, 참다", "meaning_en": "to put down by force or authority", "type": "사용자단어", "is_separated": false, "confidence": 1.0, "frequency": 1, "synonyms": "bottle up / subdue / oppress / repress / curb", "antonyms": ""}, {"original": "inclined", "context": "Negotiators focusing on values were least likely to see the problem in fixed-pie terms and more inclined to approach the situation cooperatively", "base_form": "inclined", "pos": "동사", "meaning_ko": "~하는 경향이 있다, ~하려는 성향이 있다, ~하게 기울어져 있다", "meaning_en": "have a tendency or disposition to do or be something;

Who you are and what you say may not be the same from one person to the next.

Vincent will have a very different reaction to the news than Emily, and they will each be more receptive to the news if it’s bundled with different things.
