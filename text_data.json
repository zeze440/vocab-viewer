[{"id": 1, "content": "Many people create and share pictures and videos on the Internet. The difficulty is finding what you want. Typically, people want to search using words (rather than, say, example sketches). Because most pictures don’t come with words attached, it is natural to try and build tagging systems that tag images with relevant words. The underlying machinery is straightforward ― we apply image classification and object detection methods and tag the image with the output words. But tags aren’t a comprehensive description of what is happening in an image. It matters who is doing what, and tags don’t capture this. For example, tagging a picture of a cat in the street with the object categories “cat”, “street”, “trash can” and “fish bones” leaves out the information that the cat is pulling the fish bones out of an open trash can on the street.", "words": [{"original": "leaves out", "base_form": "leave out", "pos": "phrasal_verb", "meaning_ko": "제외하다", "meaning_en": "", "type": "고정숙어", "is_separated": false, "confidence": 1.0, "frequency": 1, "synonyms": "", "antonyms": "", "context": "For example, tagging a picture of a cat in the street with the object categories “cat”, “street”, “trash can” and “fish bones” leaves out the information that the cat is pulling the fish bones out of an open trash can on the street"}, {"original": "relevant", "base_form": "relevant", "pos": "형용사", "meaning_ko": "관련된, 적절한", "meaning_en": "having a bearing on or connection with the subject at issue", "type": "사용자단어", "is_separated": false, "confidence": 1.0, "frequency": 2, "synonyms": "", "antonyms": "irrelevant", "context": "Because most pictures don’t come with words attached, it is natural to try and build tagging systems that tag images with relevant words"}, {"original": "straightforward", "base_form": "straightforward", "pos": "부사", "meaning_ko": "직접적으로", "meaning_en": "", "type": "사용자단어", "is_separated": false, "confidence": 1.0, "frequency": 1, "synonyms": "", "antonyms": "", "context": "The underlying machinery is straightforward ― we apply image classification and object detection methods and tag the image with the output words"}, {"original": "underlying", "base_form": "underlying", "pos": "동사", "meaning_ko": "기저에 깔리다, 기본적으로 있다", "meaning_en": "be or form the base for", "type": "사용자단어", "is_separated": false, "confidence": 1.0, "frequency": 1, "synonyms": "underlie", "antonyms": "", "context": "The underlying machinery is straightforward ― we apply image classification and object detection methods and tag the image with the output words"}, {"original": "classification", "base_form": "classification", "pos": "명사", "meaning_ko": "분류", "meaning_en": "the act of distributing things into classes or categories of the same type", "type": "사용자단어", "is_separated": false, "confidence": 1.0, "frequency": 1, "synonyms": "compartmentalization / assortment / sorting / compartmentalisation / categorisation", "antonyms": "declassification", "context": "The underlying machinery is straightforward ― we apply image classification and object detection methods and tag the image with the output words"}, {"original": "attached", "base_form": "attached", "pos": "동사", "meaning_ko": "붙이다, 첨부하다", "meaning_en": "cause to be attached", "type": "사용자단어", "is_separated": false, "confidence": 1.0, "frequency": 1, "synonyms": "confiscate / bond / sequester / tie / attach", "antonyms": "detach", "context": "Because most pictures don’t come with words attached, it is natural to try and build tagging systems that tag images with relevant words"}, {"original": "capture", "base_form": "capture", "pos": "동사", "meaning_ko": "잡아내다, 포착하다", "meaning_en": "succeed in representing or expressing something intangible", "type": "사용자단어", "is_separated": false, "confidence": 1.0, "frequency": 1, "synonyms": "captivate / beguile / conquer / bewitch / catch", "antonyms": "", "context": "It matters who is doing what, and tags don’t capture this"}, {"original": "comprehensive", "base_form": "comprehensive", "pos": "기타", "meaning_ko": "전반적인, 포괄적인", "meaning_en": "an intensive examination testing a students proficiency in some special field of knowledge", "type": "사용자단어", "is_separated": false, "confidence": 1.0, "frequency": 1, "synonyms": "comp / comprehensive examination", "antonyms": "", "context": "But tags aren’t a comprehensive description of what is happening in an image"}, {"original": "output", "base_form": "output", "pos": "명사", "meaning_ko": "출력물, 결과물", "meaning_en": "final product;

In this way, 'thought suppression can actually increase the thoughts one wishes to suppress instead of calming them'. One common example of this is that people on a diet who try not to think about food often begin to think much more about food. This process is therefore also known as the rebound effect. The ironic effect seems to be caused by the interplay of two related cognitive processes. This dual-process system involves, first, an intentional operating process, which consciously attempts to locate thoughts unrelated to the suppressed ones. Second, and simultaneously, an unconscious monitoring process tests whether the operating system is functioning effectively. If the monitoring system encounters thoughts inconsistent with the intended ones, it prompts the intentional operating process to ensure that these are replaced by appropriate thoughts.
